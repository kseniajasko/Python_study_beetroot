#task_2
# Create a python program named “task2”, and use the built - in function `print` in it several times.Try to pass “sep”, “end” params and pass several parameters separated by commas. Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above, with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.  (Ex.     # ‘hello world’     print(“hello world”) )
print('hello world')

#task_3
#Write a program, which has two print statements to print the following text (capital letters “O” and “H”, made from “#” symbols):

#########
#       #
#       #
#       #
#########

#       #
#       #
#########
#       #
#       #
# Pay attention that usage of spaces is forbidden, as well as creating the whole result text string using “”” ”””, use ‘\n’ and ‘\t’ symbols instead.
print('#'*9, '#\t#', '#\t#', '#\t#', '#'*9, sep='\n', end='\n \n')
print('#\t#', '#\t#', '#'*9, '#\t#', '#\t#', sep='\n')



#another

#a = 'hello';
#print(a*4, sep = '!!!');

#print("Study", "python");
#print("Study", "python", sep = '&');            #or  sep = ' & '   sep = '  '

'''print("Study", end=' - ')
